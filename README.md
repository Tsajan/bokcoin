# BOKCOIN
#### This is a CBDC web application project which has been built using the Quorum blockchain (also applicable in Ethereum). This CBDC application is aimed at the retail level with the offering of financial services (e.g., interest on deposit) as well as provisioning of whitelisting and blacklisting of account addresses, and controlled transfer of funds between account addresses.

Follow the steps below to setup the CBDC application

1. Run a Quorum blockchain network with at least two nodes. Details for setting up Quorum blockchain can be found at https://docs.goquorum.com/en/latest/Getting%20Started/Creating-A-Network-From-Scratch/ Alternately, you can also use Ganache for easy setup of an Ethereum blockchain.

2. Install NPM and Truffle
            ~~~npm install -g truffle~~~
